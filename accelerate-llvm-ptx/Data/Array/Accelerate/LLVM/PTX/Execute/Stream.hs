-- Reservoir
-- ---------
--
-- The reservoir is a place to store CUDA execution streams that are currently
-- inactive. When a new stream is requested one is provided from the reservoir
-- if available, otherwise a fresh execution stream is created.
--
-- TLM: In a multi-threaded multi-device environment, the Reservoir might need
--      to be augmented to explicitly push/pop the surrounding any operation.
--
type Reservoir  = MVar (Seq Stream.Stream)


-- Executing operations in streams
-- -------------------------------

-- | Execute an operation in a unique execution stream. The (asynchronous)
-- result is passed to a second operation together with an event that will be
-- signalled once the operation is complete. The stream and event are released
-- after the second operation completes.
--

-- Primitive operations
-- --------------------

-- | Generate a new empty reservoir. It is not necessary to pre-populate it with
-- any streams because stream creation does not cause a device synchronisation.
--
-- Additionally, we do not need to finalise any of the streams. A reservoir is
-- tied to a specific execution context, so when the reservoir dies it is
-- because the PTX state and contained CUDA context have died, so there is
-- nothing more to do.

  message ("stash stream " ++ showStream stream)

  -- TLM TODO: forkIO a thread to do the wait and stash. Need to test that.

  -- Wait for all preceding operations submitted to the stream to complete.
  --
  -- Note: Placing the block here seems to force _all_ streams to block, or at
  --       least significantly impacts the chances of other streams overlapping.
  --       However by using the 'streaming' interface, we avoid the need to
  --       block the stream here, because the binding will always be evaluated
  --       before the body begins execution.
  --
  -- Stream.block stream

  -- Note: We use a sequence here so that the old stream can be placed onto the
  --       end of the reservoir, while new streams are popped from the front.
  --       Since we don't block on the stream when returning it (see above),
  --       in this configuration most likely the stream won't be required
  --       immediately, and so it has some time yet to finish any outstanding
  --       operations (just in case).
